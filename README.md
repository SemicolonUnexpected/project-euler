# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

I thoroughly enjoy solving these problems and have used them to gain insight into several programming languages while developing my mathematical abilities. I would recommend them to anyone interested in computer science and mathematical problem-solving.

Most problems solved are in Python, working on the principle that algorithm design is more important for a solution than using a faster, compiled language. Some puzzles are also solved in C#, Haskell and Rust.
